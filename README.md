## About The Project

Globalization has impacted language use and communication patterns, including the Dutch language which has incorporated English loanwords. As part of this adaptation, the term "delete" has been introduced and is sometimes used in place of the Dutch word "verwijder" in both digital and traditional communication.

To investigate the prevalence of "delete" in Dutch tweets and determine whether there has been an increase in English words used in the Dutch language, this study aims to compare the frequency of "delete" and "verwijder" in Dutch tweets on two different dates in separate years. Analyzing these frequencies can provide insight into the overall trend of English usage in the Dutch language.
